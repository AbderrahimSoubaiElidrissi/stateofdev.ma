# 1.Overview

We, at [DevC.Morocco](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DevC.Casablanca) are a community of passionate IT professionals, sharing latest and hottest tech in darija, the moroccan dialect.

This year, we had our first "State of Dev Survey" centered around software developers in Morocco. Why? Because analytics can't give you all the feedback. So we built a survey. 49 questions around 4 main areas: education, work, tech and community. Ultimately, we wanted to know how we can help and support each other, and overall, be able to better respond to developers’ evolving needs.

Launching was pretty strategic too. What better time and place than an online tech conference? In October, [BlaBlaConf 1.0](https://blablaconf.com/) gathered thousands of viewers during a 5-day. We believe this momentum was key to the survey.

A month after that, 2287 submissions were completed. That's from Morocco only and it's close to the 2500 answers from [Stackoverflow's first survey back in 2011](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/11/survey-says/]). This number only speaks volume about how vibrant is this community.

Needless to say, with such tremendous success, we intend to make it a yearly event!

### Key results

Average software developers from Morocco are young, highly educated, with 2 to 3 years of experience. They work on modern frontend and backend web stacks.

They practice side-projects and continuous learning on a regular basis.

Remote working has been a positive step in their career, as well as being part of a local community.

### A word about methodology

As part of our core principles, all collected data is anonymized. Raw results are also available under BY-NC-SA 2.0 license. Same thing for the website code, we put everything on [DevC-Casa GitHub organization](https://github.com/DevC-Casa/stateofdev.ma).

It’s important to note that not all fields were ‘mandatory’, so the results and graphics may not reflect the respondents’ total number for every question.

We want to thank all our amazing contributors and everyone who helped share the survey to get more submissions. We’re looking forward to your feedback and share the results within your network.
