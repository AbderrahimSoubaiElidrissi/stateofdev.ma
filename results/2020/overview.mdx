# 1.Overview

We, at [GeeksBlaBla](https://geeksblabla.com/) are a community of passionate IT professionals, sharing latest and hottest tech in darija, the moroccan dialect.

This year, we had our first survey centered around software developers in Morocco. Why? Because analytics can't give you all the feedback. So we built a survey. 49 questions around 4 main areas: education, work, tech and community.

Launching was pretty strategic too. What better time and place than an online tech conference? In October, [BlaBlaConf 1.0](https://blablaconf.com/) gathered thousands of viewers during a 5-day. We believe this momentum was key to the survey.

A month after that, 2287 submissions were completed. That's from Morocco only and it's close to the 2500 answers from [Stackoverflow's first survey back in 2011](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/11/survey-says/]). This number only speaks volume about how vibrant is this community.

Needless to say, with such tremendous success, we intend to make it a yearly event!

## Key results

Average software developers from Morocco are young, highly educated, with 2 to 3 years of experience. They work on modern frontend and backend web stacks.

They practice side-projects and continuous learning on a regular basis.

Remote working has been a positive step in their career, as well as being part of a local community.

## A word about methodology

As part of our core principles, all data collected is anonymized. Raw results are also available under BY-NC-SA 2.0 license. Same thing for the website code, we put is on (Github)[https://github.com/DevC-Casa/stateofdev.ma].

We'd like to thanks the many contributors and everyone who share the survey on social networks.
