# 1.Overview

This year marks the first year that we’ve conducted the State of Dev Survey. We launched this survey with the objective of obtaining data to help us, Moroccan developers, better understand our developer community, with the main goal to improve, determine what developers are working on and how we can help and support each other, and overall, be able to better respond to developers’ evolving needs.

The survey collected data from a total of 2287 developers. We looked at a geographical location, age, developer roles, career goals, engagement within Moroccan dev communities, level of influence, and impact on annual revenue. Respondents told us about the tools and technologies they use most often, which ones they want to improve themselves in in the future, and how they’re likely to learn. It’s important to note that not all fields were ‘mandatory’, so the results and graphics may not reflect the respondents’ total number for every question.

It's important to mention that this year's survey was taken just before and after blablaconf.com and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey results are anonymized and The project is open source and hosted on DevC-Casa GitHub organization.

We want to thank all our amazing contributors and everyone who help share the survey to get more submissions. We’re looking forward to your feedback and share the results within your network.
